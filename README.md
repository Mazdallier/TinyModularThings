TinyModularThings
=================

The TinyModularThings Minecraft Mod

The TinyModularThings mod is a mod that is based on other Mods.
Simple explain it works alone. But it run as better as more you base your mods on them. Just throwing mods into a modpack and putting this mod in will make it almost useless.
You need at least a system in your modpack. If you care about that part you will have a good time with this mod.

The TinyModularThings Mod is not only 1 Mod. It is a mod that can be seen as Modpack itself. (i know sounds weird)
It contains these Mods, which are taken over / rebuilded / selfcreated / rewitten.

1: SpmodAPI: It's my mod. I just rewrite it at this Stage. You can count it as a funny Mod where will be some usefull stuff and also some plants and building blocks also some funny stuff like drugs or AnimalFarts.
2: TinyModularThing: I created it also by myself. This mod is a technic based Mod. You have a lot things which you can have with technic an co but it adds also some utility Blocks/Items/features to the Game. This mod is made for people that know what they want. The features are really obvious. The Blocks do exactly what they tell.
3: JBucketFiller: This mod is not declared inside but it is inside. This mod only adds 3 Blocks. How they work is pretty obvious. Here is The Thread Link: http://www.minecraftforum.net/forums/mapping-and-modding/minecraft-mods/1277676-vanilla-1-1-0-buildcraft-2-2-12-bucket-filler
4: Compact Windmills: Yeah this Mod is a TakeOver. I just grabbed me the source and rewirtten it. Aroma1997 said he will no longer support this mod, because he is in the IC2 Dev team. Which is a to sided sword in my Opininen. He is a guy with good ideas and not really extreme imagines, so maybe a good one for IC2. But he makes some mistakes in coding which can be bad if you use it. 
I hope they fix it. I took over the mod because i could not run it anymore on my server because it used up all my ram over time which was not funny at all. (Note: he did the same mistakes in ic2 do not know if they still exsist) The thread link to the Original Mod: http://www.minecraftforum.net/forums/mapping-and-modding/minecraft-mods/1287828-aroma1997s-mods-betterchests-mining-world-mod

Now to the Mods which i plan to take over or bring back to live.

1: BC&IC2CrossoverMod. 
2: RockedScience.
3: LaserMod (If i can)
4: Bacon Mod (Maybe i am not sure yet)
5: PowerCraft (That will sadly not happen because i am not good enough to code what they did. This mod is extremly PowerFull but also extrem dead. If there is someone who can bring it back to life like it was before without the the bugs of the 1.4.7 version what the other people did i will help as much as i can)
6: I do not know if i find more then i try it.

Core Coders: Speiger.
Texturer:

Redled72: An awsome guy who made really cool stuff in MC. Sadly he Stoped beeing in Minecraft. He made me Awesome textures and also he was one of the Creaters of TinyChest which i desinged with him together. Thank you for teaching me your knowledge Redled72, without you I would not be so deep inside of coding knowledge as now.
